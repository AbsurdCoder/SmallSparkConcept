        <div class="lead"><p>Two years from the day this article went into print, two individuals over a cup of tea toyed with the idea of manufacturing air filters for “pocket rockets and sports cruisers”. At the given time the brand had laid focus on Royal Enfield motorcycles and was happy with the current clientele. Drawing from the strengths and positive feedback sometime in the future the team got to work. A few phone calls and a prototype run later the DT400 Schorl Air Filter by Small Spark Concepts took form and was ready catch a fresh breath of air.</p><p>
</p><div>Built literally at the desk of its inventor, the DT400 Schorl Air Filter by Small Spark Concepts boasts of simple yet ingenious tech that offers the same return on tap that leading international brands do. Well sans the hefty commanding price! After the installation at Motobyte (their dealer partner’s premises) in Pune the subject was all ready to head towards the proving grounds. A 16,000 kms old January 2017 Bajaj Dominar 400.

        <div class="lead"><p>At the first blip the crisp yet deep bass grunt made its presence felt. Taking the motorcycle on a short tour to the konkan coast offered a slight bump in the mileage with better acceleration and the naturally endowed baritone exhaust note. Taking it a step further the motorcycle hit 160kmph faster while crossing the previous best 155kmph. This without a drop in current mileage with stood within the 26-29 kmpl bracket.
</p><p>Following up on its last tour the ride to India Bike Week 2019 offered better mileage. This in spite of being kept in a dusty area all day. ON its return journey the Bajaj Dominar 400 clocked in at 31.4kmpl on a full tank to full tank calibration over a distance of 220 kms.
</p><p>To talk about its performance, we put the motorcycle on a Dyno Run at the India Bike Week 2019. At the Race Dynamics podium the Bajaj Dominar churned out 28.1 whp, 1 unit more than stock. This was purely attributed to the performance of the air filter. Considering a remaining 30% shelf life of the stock drive chain sans the stock muffler and other unforeseen factors under basic conditions this indeed was a positive result for the team involved in the trials of the product.</p><p>To begin with we would like to thank our collaborators at team Dipen Nisar Autovlogs for being part of the pilot testing.
</p><p>The features of the DT400 Schorl Air Filter are:
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Mileage</li>
<li>Improved Acceleration</li>
<li>Curbing Emissions</li>
<li>Easy maintenance with simple wash and dry method</li>
<li>Product Life-cycle :100,000 Kms</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Most importantly, the product is pocket friendly and made in India.

                <div class="lead"><p>Being a motorcycle enthusiast, the poor mileage of his powerful motorcycle haunted the founder back in 2008. What could be the reason?
Three and half years of experiments on the basic working essentials of the engine,
1) Spark  2) Fuel  Air
revealed an important missing link – The Air, unlike spark and fuel cannot be seen nor be controlled effectively, thus hardly any research was done on maximizing air for intakes. If there can be performance filters why not mileage filters? The concept was essentially to change the beliefs about performance air filters. The air filter was not only to achieve better filtration and get better performance but also to gain more mileage and reduce carbon emissions. It took a little over 4 years of painstaking experiments and research to develop the technology based on micro fiber filter element and make the Air Filter that can match the ISO standards, regulations to use on engines and do the job what it is developed for.
</p><p>“We believe that the beauty is in the details: those small things which are unrecognised, unnoticeably ignored are the once which fit in the design and do the job which it is meant to do, without which the purpose is undone.”
</p><p>Mayur Patil<br><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">(Founder, Director)</span></p></div>
